# ProgrammingChallange1
This mini project involves developing a software application to play one of your favourite childhood games, the Tic Tac Toe game.  The application should have two modes. The first mode allows two humans to play the game using your software. The game should be able to be played over a network. In the second mode, a human is playing with the computer. The application should be able to maintain a record of the players who played the game, and their winning/losing statistics. This could be a standard desktop application, or a mobile application, or a combination of both.
